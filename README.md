# VinylRecord
VinylRecord (short for Vinyl ActiveRecord) is a pure SQLite ActiveRecord ORM for iOS without CoreData. It was fork of a discontinued project, iActiveRecord by Alex Denisov who pioneered a major first step in creating an ORM for iOS when they were few others in site. Desiring rapid fixes and new features for an application in dire need of a persistence layer, the API was reborn with new name as to avoid confusion with its predecessor, for which it maintains compatibility, and other ORM's with the ActiveRecord name.

# INSTALLATION  
## Using CocoaPods (Recommend)
***
    # Podfile
    pod 'VinylRecord', '1.0.9'
    
## Using Source
***

``` 
    git clone https://github.com/valerius/VinylRecord.git
```
1. Checkout code
2. Open with XCode and build Build_Framework target.  
3. The ActiveRecord.framework will be located in ~/Products/, this path can be changed in the shell-script in the Settings tab of target.  
4. Open your project Settings and add ActiveRecord.framework and sqlite3.0.dylib to Link Binary With Libraries section.  



# USAGE
## Initialize the database

Upon your application loading you should initialize the database. Keep in mind, that a configuration only happens once, so if you use CocoaPods which has VinylRecord as a dependency, you should initialize your database before utilizing the CocoaPods library initialization procedures, if any, otherwise your settings will not have an effect.

```objective-c
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application  didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        [VinylRecord applyConfiguration:^(ARConfiguration *config) {
                        config.databasePath = ARCachesDatabasePath(nil); //creates default database path
                        config.enableThreadPool = YES; //Enables a database connection per thread
                        config.migrationsEnabled = YES; //Enables simple migrations
        }];
    }
```

## Create your models
To create a model you should subclass the VinylRecord class, which is a descendant of its predecessors ActiveRecord class which it remains compatible with. The Framework will automatically create a database table using the classes inherited from VinylRecord when you run app first time.

So based on this code
```objective-c

    #import <ActiveRecord/VinylRecord.h> // when not using CocoaPods
    #import "VinylRecord.h" // when using CocoaPods
    
    @interface User : VinylRecord
        column_dec(string,name)
        column_dec(boolean,active)
         // or  @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *name;
    @end
    
    @implementation User
        column_imp(string,name) // or @dynamic 
        column_imp(boolean,active) // user.is_active = YES or user.has_active not available using @dynamic
    @end
``` 

Table 'user' will be created. It will contain 'name' and 'active' field.  

After describing the model you can start using the framework for persisting and querying objects:

```objective-c
    User *user = [User new];
    user.name = @"Alex";
    [user save];

    NSArray *users = [User allRecords];
    User *userForRemove = [users first];
    [userForRemove dropRecord];
```
This code creates, retrieves a list and deletes the model.

## Excluding certain properties

What about the properties that should not be stored in a database?  Currently all properties that are not marked @dynamic are ignored.

# DATA TYPES
## Definitions
VinylRecord supports the typical sql types, which may be either defined using simple macro definition (recommended), or using standard property definitions with the respective @dynamic attribute in the implementation. The macros are prefered because they easily help you visually distinguish between database columns and in some cases, provides additional helper methods.

```objective-c

    @interface DataTypes : VinylRecord
        column_dec(string,property_of_string) // NSString
        column_dec(integer,property_of_integer) // NSNumber
        column_dec(boolean,property_of_boolean) // NSNumber
        column_dec(decimal,property_of_decimal) // NSDecimalNumber
        column_dec(blob,property_of_blob) // NSData
        column_dec(date,property_of_date) // NSDate
        column_dec(dictionary,property_of_dictionary) // NSMutableDictionary
        column_dec(array,property_of_array) // NSMutableArray
    @end
    
    @implementation DataTypes
        column_imp(string,property_of_string)
        column_imp(integer,property_of_integer) // dataTypes.int_property_of_integer = 10; or dataTypes.int_property_of_integer = @(10)
        column_imp(boolean,property_of_bool) // dataTypes.has_property_of_bool,is_property_of_bool or [dataTypes.property_of_bool booleanValue]
        column_imp(decimal,property_of_decimal)
        column_imp(blob,property_of_blob)
        column_imp(date,property_of_date)
        column_imp(dictionary,property_of_dictionary)
        column_imp(array,property_of_array)
        // or @dynamic property_name which doesn't generate helpers
    @end
    
```

# VALIDATION

Validations may be registered using the validation_do helper macro inside the implementation of the model.


```objective-c
    // User.h
    @interface User : VinylRecord  <ARValidatorProtocol>
        column_dec(string,name)
    @end
    
    // User.m
    @implementation User
        column_imp(string,name)
        
        validation_do(
            validate_uniqueness_of(name)
            validate_presence_of(name)
        )
    @end
```

 Standard validations, such as validate_uniqueness_of and validate_presence_of will have existing helpers, but you may add your own custom validations also. Just define a new class and implement <ARValidatorProtocol> as follows:
 

```objective-c
   
    //  Custom validator
    //  PrefixValidator.h
    @interface PrefixValidator : NSObject <ARValidatorProtocol>
    @end
    
    //  PrefixValidator.m
    @implementation PrefixValidator
    - (NSString *)errorMessage {
        return @"Invalid prefix";
    }
    - (BOOL)validateField:(NSString *)aField ofRecord:(id)aRecord {
        NSString *aValue = [aRecord valueForKey:aField];
        BOOL valid = [aValue hasPrefix:@"LOL"];
        return valid;
    }
    @end
```

then add validator to your ActiveRecord implementation

```objective-c
   
    @implementation User
        validation_do(
            validate_field_with_validator(name, PrefixValidator)
        )
    @end
    
```

Validation errors

```objective-c
    
    User *user = [User new];
    if(![user isValid]){
        NSArray *errors = [user errorMessages];
        //  do something
    }

        // or

    User *user = [User new];
    if(![user save]){
        NSArray *errors = [user errorMessages];
        //  do something
    }
    
```
# ASSOCIATIONS

VinylRecords supports mapping relationships, BelongsTo, HasMany, and HasManyThrough, with "ON DELETE" dependencies DESTROY and NULLIFY which may be specified using their respective macros. 


## HasMany <-> BelongsTo

A **belongs_to** association sets up a one-to-one connection with another model, such that each instance of the declaring model "belongs to" one instance of the other model. For example, if your application includes users and groups, and each user can be assigned to exactly one group, you'd declare the model this way:

```objective-c 
    // User.h
    @interface User : VinylRecord
        belongs_to_dec(Group, group, ARDependencyDestroy) // or ARDependencyNullify
        // or belongs_to_dec(Group, group, groupId, ARDependencyDestroy) // groupId is automatic in above example
        column_dec(string,name)
    @end
    
    // User.m
    @implementation User
        belongs_to_imp(Group, group, ARDependencyDestroy)
        // or belongs_to_imp(Group, group, groupId, ARDependencyDestroy) // groupId is automatic in above example
        column_imp(string,name)
    @end
```

Above, the **belongs_to_dec** and **belongs_to_imp** take three or four parameters: the model class name ('Group'), getter name ('group'), optionally the required column name which is assumed to be the 'getter' name plus an 'Id' suffix, followed by a destruction method of **ARDependencyDestroy** to delete the object, or **ARDependencyNullify** to null the object upon destroying the parent of the association (e.g. Group). The main thing to remember when describing the column key of a relationship if the default one is insufficient, is that it must match the name of the associated Class and begin with lowercase letters, followed by the 'Id' suffix. Examples follow:

```
    Group      <->     groupId  
    User       <->     userId  
    ContentManager <->  contentManagerId
 ```



 **NOTE:** while VinylRecord is virtually 100% compatible with its predecessor, the difference exists here in that you nolonger have to specify the key separately, the logic being that since the key is always required it is always generated by the macro. Thus, worse case, where a compile error arises noting that the property is already defined, you need need only delete the duplicate property that is not generated by the macro.


### Describe reverse relationship

A **has_many** association indicates a one-to-many connection with another model. You'll often find this association on the "other side" of a **belongs_to** association. This association indicates that each instance of the model has zero or more instances of another model. In correlation with  the prior example, the Group model would be declared as follows:

```objective-c 
    // Group.h
    @interface Group : VinylRecord
        has_many_dec(User, users, ARDependencyDestroy)
        column_dec(string,title)
    @end

    // Group.m
    @implementation Group
        has_many_imp(User, users, ARDependencyDestroy)
        column_imp(string,title)
    @end
```

Additionally, the macros generate helper methods for you to added associated objects in the form below:  

    add##ModelName:(ActiveRecord *)aRecord;
    remove##ModelName:(ActiveRecord *)aRecord;

Thus, you may add Users to Groups below:

```objective-c
    
    @implementation GroupTest
        - (void) addStudents {
            User *john = [User new];
            john.name = @"John";
                
            User *alex = [User new:@{"name": @"Alex"}]; // assign properties in constructor
                
            Group *students = [Group new];
            students.title = @"Students";
            [students addUser:john];
            [students addUser:alex];
          
            NSAssert([students.users count] == 2,@"Cached students should == 2");
            NSAssert([students save] == TRUE, @"Should save group and users");
            NSAssert([students.users count] == 2,@"Persisted students count should == 2");
      }
    @end
```

## HasManyThrough

A **has_many_through** association is often used to set up a many-to-many connection with another model. This association indicates that the declaring model can be matched with zero or more instances of another model by proceeding "through" a third model.

In the example below, the **has_many_through** takes four arguments, the associated class to be returned, the model used to reference both endpoints of the association, the getter used to return results from the association and the action taken upon the "through" model should the receiving association be deleted.

```objective-c

    // User.h
    @interface User : VinylRecord
        has_many_through_dec(Project, UserProjectRelationship, projects, ARDependencyDestroy)
        column_dec(string,name)
    @end
    
    // User.m
    @implementation User
        has_many_through_imp(Project, UserProjectRelationship, projects, ARDependencyDestroy)
        column_imp(string,name)
    @end
    
    // Project.h
    @interface Project : VinylRecord
        has_many_through_dec(User, UserProjectRelationship, users, ARDependencyDestroy)
        column_dec(string,name)
    @end
    
    // Project.m
    @implementation Project
        has_many_through_imp(User, UserProjectRelationship, users, ARDependencyDestroy)
        column_imp(string,name)
    @end
```

To complete this relationship, you need to create the "through" model to link the association in both directions. 

```objective-c

    // UserProjectRelationship.h
    @interface UserProjectRelationship : VinylRecord
        column_dec(key,userId)
        column_dec(key,projectId)
    @end
    
    // UserProjectRelationship.m
    @implementation UserProjectRelationship
        column_imp(key,userId)
        column_imp(key,projectId)
    @end
    
```
Example usage:

```objective-c

    @implementation HasManyThroughTest
        - (void)testHasManyTrough {
            User userJohn = [User new: @{"name":"john"}];
            Project *makeTea = [Project new: {@"name": "Make tea"}];
            [makeTea addUser:userJohn];
            [makeTea save];
            NSAssert([makeTea.users count]  == 1, @"Project should have 1 user");
            NSAssert([userJohn.projects count]  == 1, @"User should have 1 project");
        }
    @end

```



# TRANSACTIONS

VinylRecords supports regular and save point transactions which are now thread safe, utilizing  SQLite support for Isolation and Concurrency by maintaining a separate database connection for each thread accessing the database which are automatically shutdown when the thread exits and separately, serially queued using GCD. This ensures that transaction in a background thread if rolled back, doesn't rollback unrelated queries placed on a separate thread. You may also nest SAVEPOINT transactions as deep as SQLite and your phone will allow.

```objective-c   

    [VinylRecord transaction:^{
        User *alex = [User new];
        alex.name = @"Alex";
        [alex save];
    }];

    [VinylRecord transaction:^{
        User *alex = [User new];
        alex.name = @"Alex";
        [alex save];
        ar_rollback;
    }];
    
    [VinylRecord savePointTransaction:^(ARTransactionState *state_a) {
        ... // A Changes.
        BOOL success = [ActiveRecord savePointTransaction:^(ARTransactionState *state_b) {
            ... // These changes are folled back
            ar_rollback_to(state_b);
    
        }]; 
                   
        if(success) {
            //we could rollback, or keep state_a change. To rollback: ar_rollback(state_a);        
        }
    }]; 
```


# QUERIES WITH FILTERS AND FINDERS

VinylRecord supports numerous methods to allow querying records, including using **where** statements, objective-C query **whereField:** methods,  and predefined **findBy** methods.

All methods except **findBy** helpers returns an instance of ARLazyFetcher, which allows you to chain queries in a single row:

```objective-c

    NSArray *users = [[[[User query] offset:5] limit:2] fetchRecords];

```

The fetchRecords method initiates sql-query to the database on the basis of all conditions applied:

```objective-c

    ARLazyFetcher *fetcher = [[[User query] offset:2] limit:10];
    [fetcher whereField:@"name"
           equalToValue:@"Alex"];
    NSArray *users = [fetcher fetchRecords];

```
There are several options for 'where' methods:

```
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)whereField:(NSString *)aField equalToValue:(id)aValue;
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)whereField:(NSString *)aField notEqualToValue:(id)aValue;
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)whereField:(NSString *)aField in:(NSArray *)aValues;
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)whereField:(NSString *)aField notIn:(NSArray *)aValues;
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)whereField:(NSString *)aField like:(NSString *)aPattern;
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)whereField:(NSString *)aField notLike:(NSString *)aPattern;
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)whereField:(NSString *)aField between:(id)startValue and:(id)endValue;
```

You can also concatenate with finalStatement some "complex" or a simple filter. 

Relationship HasManyThrough is already use the 'where' filter, so if you want to add more, you should use code like this:

    NSArray *ids = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:
                   [NSNumber numberWithInt:1],
                   [NSNumber numberWithInt:15], 
                   nil];
                  
    ARLazyFetcher *fetcher = [[User query]  where:@"'name' = %@ or 'id' in %@",  @"john", ids, nil];
    NSArray *records = [[fetcher orderBy:@"id"] fetchRecords];

SQLite SQL comparisons:

 - =, == - equality
 - >= - left-hand operand greater or equal then right-hand operand
 - <= - right-hand operand greater or equal then left-hand operand
 - > - left-hand operand greater then right-hand operand
 - < - right-hand operand greater then left-hand operand
 - !=, <> - operands are not equal
 - LIKE, NOT LIKE - pattern matching
 - IN, NOT IN container - records which fields are in container (NSArray, NSSet etc.)
 - BETWEEN %1 AND %2 - records with fields in range(%1, %2)

## Fetch only needed fields

    - (ARLazyFetcher *)only:(NSString *)aFirstParam, ...;
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)except:(NSString *)aFirstParam, ...;

    ARLazyFetcher *fetcher = [[User query] only:@"name", @"id", nil];
    NSArray *users = [fetcher fetchRecords];

## Sorting

    - (ARLazyFetcher *)orderBy:(NSString *)aField ascending:(BOOL)isAscending;
    - (ARLazyFetcher *)orderBy:(NSString *)aField;// ASC by default

    ARLazyFetcher *fetcher = [[[User query] offset:2] limit:10];
    [[fetcher whereField:@"name"
           equalToValue:@"Alex"] orderBy:@"name"];
    NSArray *users = [fetcher fetchRecords];

## Join

The framework supports the use of joins:

    - (ARLazyFetcher *)join:(Class)aJoinRecord
                    useJoin:(ARJoinType)aJoinType
                    onField:(NSString *)aFirstField
                   andField:(NSString *)aSecondField;

aJoinRecord - a model for which we use join  
aJoinType - type of join,  may be several options  
* ARJoinLeft  
* ARJoinRight  
* ARJoinInner  
* ARJoinOuter  
aFirstField - a field on which the current model will be join  
aSecondField - a field on which the aJoinModel will be join  

Joined records can be fetched by sending

    - (NSArray *)fetchJoinedRecords;

message to ARLazyFetcher instance.

# MIGRATIONS  

VinylRecord supports simple migrations which will automatically add new tables or new columns to an already existing table, without loss of data. if you don't need migrations, you should disable them at start of application.

```objective-c
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application  didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        [VinylRecord applyConfiguration:^(ARConfiguration *config) {
                        config.migrationsEnabled = NO;
        }];
    }
```
